This project shows the development of a personal portfolio website that highlights my academic background, technical skills, and my passion for the game of chess. It combines semantic HTML, CSS styling, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing representation of my interests and achievements. The website features sections showcasing my courses, technologies I've worked with and my proficiency with them, and a dedicated page for my chess hobby, including fun facts and interactive elements. With the vibrant color palette and interesting information, this project effectively communicates both my academic and personal interests in a polished and engaging way.

## Technical Achievements
1. **Navigation Menu Border Bottom:** Adds a golden border to the bottom of the menu for a chess-like elegance. Also added a dashed border around the form and padding which ensures that it is evenly spaced out.
2. **Section and Form Box Shadow:** Introduces a soft shadow around content boxes to make them visually pop.
3. **Footer Style:** Applies a dark background and white text to the footer to keep the aesthetic consistent and the theme realized.
4. **Checkbox and Radio Button Scaling** Input elements for checkboxes and radio buttons are scaled up using the transform property for better visibility and usability. Also added a right margin to space out labels and inputs for clarity.
5. **Aside Gradient Styling** The "Fun Fact" section which is an aside block uses a gradient background and italic text. A golden left border highlights the section and aligns with the theme. Lastly, there is extra padding on the left to balance the look.
6. **Bouncing JavaScript Animation** Added a smooth vertical bouncing animation to the "Fun Fact" section using JavaScript for subtle motion.
7. **Added an Image of Chess Pieces to Index Page**: Incorporated a image and styled it using CSS for a balanced layout with the text sections.
8. **Header Element:** Used the `<header>` element to structure the website's title and navigation menu, ensuring semantic clarity and better accessibility.
9. **Footer Element:** Added a `<footer>` element with a consistent dark background, housing copyright information to provide a clear end to the webpage.
10. **Aside Element:** Implemented the `<aside>` element to display the "Fun Fact" section, visually separating it from the main content for emphasis and thematic enhancement.
11. **Article Element:** Utilized the `<article>` element for the "About Chess" section, semantically marking it as self-contained content relevant to the page's topic.


### Design Achievements
1. Integrated a four-color palette: #F39C12 (golden orange) for accents (e.g., navigation border and table headers), #2C3E50 (dark blue-gray) for headings and navigation background, #FFFFFF (white) for section backgrounds and text clarity, and #398C5E (dark green) for the "Why I Love Chess" section to add a fresh, thematic touch.

2. **Used the Montserrat Font from Google Fonts**: Applied Montserrat as the primary font for all text on the website for a clean and modern look.
